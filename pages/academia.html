  <div class="about-row">
    <div class="about-text">
      <p>
        My creative identity has been shaped by mentors like Kieran Reid, the passion for creativity embodied by Adam Savage, and a lifelong engagement with games, books, and storytelling. I believe successful creative professionals are innovative, resilient, reflective, and collaborative, and I model these qualities in my teaching by embracing experimentation, encouraging iteration, and sharing my own creative journey.
      </p>
      <p>
        I foster originality, critical thinking, and reflection by combining hands-on practice with guided reflection, encouraging students to challenge conventions while maintaining professional standards. I believe students learn best in creative disciplines through continuous making, testing, and refining their ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the short term, my goals are to mentor more students, improve classroom engagement, and showcase my own creative work to inspire learners. Over the next three to five years, I aim to build stronger industry partnerships, help design curricula aligned with industry needs, and publish my own creative works, advancing student success and fostering innovation.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am also focused on refining assessment design to mirror real-world industry expectations and developing advanced skills in Unreal Engine, level design, and narrative design, ensuring students graduate with practical, industry-relevant capabilities.

  <h2 class="purpleClass yellow-outline-shadow">Teaching & Facilitation Experience</h2>
  <div class="about-row">
    <div class="about-text">
      <p>
        I teach a variety of in-person modules at SAE Institute, including HC Scripting 1, Game Production 1 & 3, Scripting 2 & 3, Game Studies 3 & 4, BA Academic Literature, and Final Project guidance. My approach is studio-based, with short theory inputs immediately followed by practical application, including stand-ups, playtests, and critique sessions inspired by industry workflows.
      </p>
      <p>
        I support students beyond formal teaching through one-on-one consultations, structured check-ins, and mentoring for major projects. This includes guidance in concept development, project planning, technical problem-solving, and portfolio preparation, helping students gain confidence and readiness for industry careers.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also contribute to curriculum and assessment development by designing project-based tasks with milestones, playtesting, and iterative feedback, ensuring students are assessed on real production skills that mirror professional game development.
      </p>
      <p>
        I integrate research into my teaching, including studies on active learning, studio-based education, and my own research into player engagement and character connection, to inform lesson structure, assessment design, and guidance in narrative and interactive design.

  <h2 class="blueClass yellow-outline-shadow">Innovation & Digital Tools</h2>
  <div class="about-row">
    <div class="about-text">
      <p>
        I use a hands-on, project-driven teaching approach where students learn through creating and testing their own work. Digital tools I employ include Unity for demonstrations, prototyping, and assessment feedback, and Canvas for sharing resources, submissions, and tracking progress.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lessons are designed to meet VARK principles, combining visual, auditory, reading/writing, and hands-on activities. Students watch demos, discuss concepts, read guides or briefs, and immediately apply ideas in practical tasks, ensuring deep understanding and skill development.

  <h2 class="purpleClass yellow-outline-shadow">Industry Experience</h2>
  <div class="about-row">
    <div class="about-text">
      <p>
        I bring eight years of experience in game development, including publishing <em>Mighty Mzansi</em> with MTN through Penrose Gaming, teaching at SAE and Wits University, and running community initiatives like game jams and meetups. I maintain strong connections with the South African creative industry and have presented at Comic Con Africa and local events.
      </p>
      <p>
        This industry background allows me to contextualize theory with practical insights, helping students prepare for real-world challenges and contributing to SAE’s mission of industry readiness and innovation.

  <h2 class="blueClass yellow-outline-shadow">Campus Engagement & Professional Development</h2>
  <div class="about-row">
    <div class="about-text">
      <p>
        I actively participate in campus and community initiatives, representing SAE at events like Comic Con Africa, Rage Expo, and Joburg Games Fest, and supporting student engagement through showcases, workshops, and competitions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Professional development includes attending and presenting at workshops, conferences, and festivals, such as AviJozi Unreal Engine Workshop (Sep 2025), Joburg Games Fest (Oct 2025), and Comic Con Africa (Aug 2025), enhancing my skills and teaching relevance.

  <h2 class="purpleClass yellow-outline-shadow">Student Impact & Feedback</h2>
  <div class="about-row">
    <div class="about-text">
      <p>
        Student evaluations consistently highlight appreciation for practical, hands-on teaching, project-based learning, and iterative feedback. Students value my approachability, mentorship, and real-world insights, which support confidence and creative growth.
      </p>
      <p>
        I implement interventions for underperforming students, including extra lessons, one-on-one guidance, and targeted feedback, resulting in improved understanding, project quality, and student retention. Peer and ALOT reviews have affirmed my effectiveness, validating my studio-based, active learning approach while motivating continuous improvement.
