    <p>
      Hi, and welcome to my portfolio. I’m a game designer and educator with a
      passion for designing systems that create meaning, emotion, and player
      agency.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m particularly interested in player–character connection and how
      mechanics shape the way players understand and inhabit fictional worlds. I
      enjoy working across digital, tabletop, and experimental projects.
